# Pizza Creations

Web app designed to be able to create and manage pizzas. Users can add, remove, and change toppings available to then be used to create pizzas full of different toppings. These pizzas can then be edited or removed as desired.

The toppings added and pizzas created are stored in the user's browser and will remain available upon returning to the app.

This is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and so will run right in the browser. To see a live version of the app, follow the link below!
